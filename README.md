##Long Distance Zither

Long Distance Zither consists of two physical keyed zithers whose strings are activated at both ends.
These zithers can be connected to a computer and to each other over the internet so that
the notes played on one zither are transmitted the other.

This connection is facilitated through a client/server relationship similar to a chat application.
ToneJS and Google Chrome allow for a USB MIDI connection from the embedded electronics in the zither
to be sent through the server. The zither on the other end will receive MIDI messages through the USB MIDI as well.
The internal electronics will active the strings using solenoids.
